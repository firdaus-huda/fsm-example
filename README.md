# ðŸ¥· Ninja FSM (Unity 2D Platformer)

This Unity project demonstrates a Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation for controlling a 2D Ninja character using C#. The character transitions between various states like Idle, Run, Jump, Attack, Hurt, and Die, with smooth animation integration and input handling.
